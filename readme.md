# PowerShell KeePass
PSKeePass is a PowerShell module that combines the ease of the PowerShell cli and the flexibility of its scripting languange to provide a powerful and easy to use management and automating platform for KeePass databases.

## Features
1. Database Configuration Profiles - Supports mutliple databases and authentication options.
2. Getting, Creating, Updating, and Removing KeePass Entries and Groups. - All of these perform as much automatic database authentication as possible using the database configuration profile. For databases that use a masterkey (password) it will prompt for it.
3. Generating KeePass Passwords - Supports most character sets and advanced keepass options. Also supports creating password profiles that can be specified to create a new password with the same rule set.
